            One chilly February evening, I found myself walking down a quiet street south of Los Angeles’ Koreatown neighborhood. A buzz in my pocket pulled my attention downwards, towards the texts from my friends asking when I would be arriving. With my eyes on my phone as I rounded the corner, I didn’t catch sight of the marquee until I was right underneath it.

            I stood at the entrance of the historic Catch One nightclub, a famous bastion of queer of color community organizing and one of the strongholds of early AIDS activism in LA – a fitting venue for tonight’s event, a historic building for a historic occasion. For the first time in the almost two years that I had been researching Los Angeles’ queer Asian American nightlife scene, a collaborative party was being thrown by several different community and presenting organizations. In the context of a scene that had been decimated by Covid and then had been regrowing in isolated patches throughout the LA metro area, this was a night full of excitement and optimism – two stages, five drag performers, ten DJs, an indoor night market, a pole dancing showcase, and installations by local artists and sex workers, all coming together to celebrate Lunar New Year.
