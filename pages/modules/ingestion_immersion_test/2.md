            Posters for this event, which was titled “Dragon Fruit,” were created by LA and Tokyo-based designer and DJ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pizzanobone/" target="_blank">Boneless Pizza</a>. Designed in the style of a grocery store flyer, this poster featured performer headshots grafted onto various produce, seafood, and meat items accompanied by phonetic Chinese transliterations of the performers’ names – and, just in case there was any confusion, a parenthetical explanation of the true nature of the event in the top right corner (“it’s a party”). The use of grocery market imagery was fitting. Of the four organizations which had come together to produce this event, only one was not directly food related: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qna.la/" target="_blank">QNA</a>, a play on “queer and Asian.” Of the other three, one, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mayumi_market/" target="_blank">Mayumi Market</a>, regularly produces food-centric community markets; the other two, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hotpotktown/" target="_blank">HOTPOT</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sendnoodzparty/" target="_blank">Send Noodz</a>, not only both include obvious culinary references in their names but are also well known for producing events which, in various ways, mix food and nightlife. Food imagery continued to be central even within the party itself – one performance, for instance, featured drag queens <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bibidiscoteca/" target="_blank">Bibi Discoteca</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missshumai/" target="_blank">Miss Shu Mai</a> (yes, named after the dim sum) both dressed as dragon fruit and eating an actual dragon fruit live on stage.
