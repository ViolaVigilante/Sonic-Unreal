## Jekyll Workflow
* Testing Locally
    1. Edit code in VS Code
    2. Using command line, run this command in repository directory: <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>
    3. Copy output URL into browser
    4. Make sure to commit changes regularly, with documentation, through GitHub Desktop
* Deploying
    1. (Is running bundle through command line necessary?)
    2. Commit latest changes to master through GitHub Desktop
    3. Push commits to origin using GitHub Desktop
    4. Review changes at GitHub public URL
